# stanford-algorithms-specialization
4-course Coursera specialization taught by Stanford professor Tim Roughgarden.  It covers the fundamentals of the design and analysis of algorithms.

## Four Courses
1. **Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms.** Covers: asymptotic ("Big-oh") notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).
1. **Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures.** Covers: data structures (heaps, balanced search trees, hash tables, bloom filters), graph primitives (applications of breadth-first and depth-first search, connectivity, shortest paths), and their applications (ranging from deduplication to social network analysis).
1. **Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming.** Covers: greedy algorithms (scheduling, minimum spanning trees, clustering, Huffman codes) and dynamic programming (knapsack, sequence alignment, optimal search trees).
1. **Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them.** Covers: shortest paths (Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Johnson), NP-completeness and what it means for the algorithm designer, and strategies for coping with computationally intractable problems (analysis of heuristics, local search).
